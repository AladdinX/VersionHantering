  <h1>Terminology</h1>
  <ol>

    <li>Repository</li>
    <p>A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository
      contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories
      can
      have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.</p>

    <li>Branch</li>
    <p>A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the
      primary
      or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you
      want
      to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.</p>

    <li>Clone</li>
    <p>A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the
      act of
      making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track
      of
      your changes without having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to the remote version so
      that you
      can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when
      you're online.
    </p>
  </ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Commit</li>
    <p>A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your
      work,
      Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes
      committed
      along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what
      changes
      were made.
    </p>
    <li>Push</li>
    <p>To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change
      something
      locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.</p>
    <li>Pull</li>
    <p>Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote
      file
      you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date. See also
      fetch.
    </p>
    <li>Merge</li>
    <p>Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.
      This
      often happens as a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A
      merge can
      be done through a pull request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always
      be
      done via the command line.</p>
  </ol>
  <li>Working directory</li>
  <li>Staging</li>
  <p>A way to test modifications before they are applied to your actual GitHub Enterprise instance.
  </p>
  <li>HEAD</li>
  <p>A defined commit of a branch, usually the most recent commit at the tip of the branch.
  </p>
  <li>Revert</li>
  <p>When you revert a pull request on GitHub, a new pull request is automatically opened, which has one commit that
    reverts
    the merge commit from the original merged pull request. In Git, you can revert commits with git revert.</p>
  <li>Reset</li>
