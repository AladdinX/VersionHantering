    <li>Commit</li>
    <p>A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your
      work,
      Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes
      committed
      along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what
      changes
      were made.
    </p>
    <li>Push</li>
    <p>To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change
      something
      locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.</p>
    <li>Pull</li>
    <p>Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote
      file
      you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date. See also
      fetch.
    </p>
    <li>Merge</li>
    <p>Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.
      This
      often happens as a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A
      merge can
      be done through a pull request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always
      be
      done via the command line.</p>
